# tox has some advantages over travis runners:
# it tests installation from the sdist, which will
# report things like missing header files.

# Run the tests a second time without pypy and without py33.
# Travis doesn't install py33 (promised Real Soon Nowâ„¢, see
# travis-ci/travis-cookbooks#89), and has PyPy 1.9 which is
# too old (want a PPA to upgrade).
